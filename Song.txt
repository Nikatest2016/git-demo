If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice


All across the world
In every nation

It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together
To release the pressure
We need a holiday

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
